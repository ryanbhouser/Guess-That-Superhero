## About this project
Guess that Superhero is a browser-based, name guessing game.  The player can use the onscreen or physical keyboard to guess letters that are in the missing phrase.  Players get 5 lives, losing 1 each time a letter is incorrectly guessed.  Will the player save the universe?  Only if they guess the correct word!
