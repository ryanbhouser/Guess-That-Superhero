## About this project

Guess that Superhero is a browser-based, name guessing game. The player can use the onscreen or physical keyboard to guess letters that are in the missing phrase. Players get 5 lives, losing 1 each time a letter is incorrectly guessed. Will the player save the universe? Only if they guess the correct word!
